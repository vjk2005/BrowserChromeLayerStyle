Browser Chrome as a Photoshop Layer Style
=======================

#About:
=======================

I needed a quick and easy shortcut to making Browser Chrome for screenshots on my sites. The problem with the usual Browser chrome PSDs is that, while visually accurate, they are not easily customizable. If I decide to change the screenshot it takes a lot of pushing and pulling to resize the chrome to match the new size of the screenshot. That's where my Browser Chrome Layer Style comes in. Since it's a layer style, you can change the dimensions and the chrome follows the changes automatically. You can dig in to the styles and change the colors and position easily. 

#Usage:
=======================
Download the ".asl" file and import it using your Photoshop Presets Manager. It should now show up in your styles panel
