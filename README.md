Browser Chrome as a Photoshop Layer Style
=======================

![Screenshot](/README/Browser-Chrome-as-Layer-Style.png)


##About:
I needed a quick and easy shortcut to making browser chrome for screenshots. I began using PSDs but soon ran into problems when I needed to resize the screenshots. It takes a lot of pushing and pulling to resize the chrome to match the resized screenshot. That's where my Browser Chrome layer style comes in. Since it's a layer style, you can change the dimensions and the chrome follows the changes automatically. It's a simple style so you can dig in and customize colors and position quite easily and make your own variations (dark chrome, for instance).

##Usage:
Download the ".asl" file and import it using your Photoshop Presets Manager. It should now show up in your styles panel.

##Contribution:
Accepting pull requests with improvements/variations.
